## Project Overview

[Imperial Research Project] is an interdisciplinary study aimed at developing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to predict urban climate patterns. This project brings together expertise from computer science, environmental science, and mathematics to explore the complex interactions between urban infrastructure and local weather systems.

Our research focuses on improving the accuracy of short-term weather forecasts in densely populated areas using real-time sensor data and historical climate records. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures and ensemble methods, we aim to enhance the reliability and precision of urban weather predictions.

### Key Features

- Real-time sensor data integration
